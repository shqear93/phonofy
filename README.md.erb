# <%= spec.name.capitalize %>

<%= spec.description %>

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem '<%= spec.name %>'
```

And then execute:

```shell
bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```shell
gem install <%= spec.name %>
```

## **Usage**
To use <%= spec.name %>, simply call the **phonofy** method in your Rails model:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  phonofy
end
```

This will add phone number validation and formatting to the **phone_number** attribute of the **Driver** model.

You can also specify a custom attribute name for the phone number:

```ruby
class Contact < ApplicationRecord
  phonofy :mobile_number
end
```

This will add phone number validation and formatting to the **mobile_number** attribute of the **Contact** model.

You can also pass additional options to <%= spec.name %> to customize its behavior:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  phonofy :phone, phonelib: { countries: [:us, :ca], types: [:mobile] }
end
```

This will add phone number validation and formatting to the **phone** attribute of the **User** model, and restrict it to US and Canada mobile phone numbers.


## **Configuration**

You can configure <%= spec.name %> by creating an initializer file in your Rails application and setting the default options:

```ruby
# config/initializers/<%= spec.name %>.rb
<%= spec.name.capitalize %>.configure do |config|
  config.default_phonelib_options = { countries: [:us, :ca], types: [:mobile] }
  config.default_twilio_options = { lookup: { type: :carrier_type } }
end
```

This will set the default options for <%= spec.name %> to validate only US and Canada mobile phone numbers using the Phonelib library, and perform a Twilio lookup to get carrier information for the phone number.
